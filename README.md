# ARCHE-ICONS

[![ARCHE Metadata Ingest](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-icons/actions/workflows/arche.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-icons/actions/workflows/arche.yml)

A set of icons to be used for the GUI of ARCHE to aid in visually representing the different classes of the ARCHE ontology in search results. Current classes represented with the icons are: acdh:TopCollection, acdh:Collection, acdh:Resource, acdh:Metadata, acdh:Project, acdh:Publication, acdh:Organisation, acdh:Person, and acdh:Place.

This repository is also used to ingest these icons into a dedicated data collection on ARCHE `ARCHE Utility Files`
